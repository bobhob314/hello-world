# Homeostasis

> If you guys find any mistakes please leave a comment.

1. Two coordinating centres for temperature control are the **hypothalamus** and **skin receptors** [not sure].
2. In order to reduce heat loss, body hairs **raise**, this is also called **goosebumps** or **piloerection**.
3. Cold sensors on the **skin** [not sure] and temperature sensors in the **hypothalamus** act as monitors.
4. Thyroxin is released by the **thyroid gland**, it increases **metabolism**, which heats up the body.
5. **Shivering** (contraction) of muscles allows the body to produce more heat.
6. When the body is overheated, blood vessels **vasodilate** in order to cool down. This is also called **widening of blood vessels** [not sure].
7. Homeostasis of body temperature involves a **negative** feedback loop.
8. Humans are **homeotherms** which means they maintain a constant body temperature.
9. **Ectotherms** depend on external sources of heat to maintain body temperature.
10. White fat is primarily found in **white fat cells** [seems like too easy of an answer. someone help].
